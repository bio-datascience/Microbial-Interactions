# Microbial-Interactions


This repository corresponds to the manuscript "Predictive Modeling of Microbial Data with Interaction Effects"

It contains code for performing quadratic interaction modeling for all data types in which microbial abundance information typically appears: 

(i) quantitative microbiome, also referred to as absolute counts, 
(ii) presence-absence information, or 
(iii) relative count information, also known as compositional data.


The individual results in the manuscript can be reproduced within the individual Rmd files.
